## Introduction
The C code provided here allows users to perform a wide range of matrix operations conveniently. These operations are commonly used in various mathematical and scientific applications.

## Functions
The code includes the following functions:
- `determinant`: Computes the determinant of a square matrix.
- `singularity`: Checks if a matrix is singular or non-singular.
- `checksymmetricity`: Determines whether a matrix is symmetric, skew-symmetric, or neither.
- `adjoint`: Computes the adjoint of a matrix.
- `inverse`: Calculates the inverse of a square matrix.
- `Addition`: Performs addition of two matrices.
- `subtraction`: Computes the subtraction of two matrices.
- `scalarmultiplication`: Multiplies a matrix by a scalar.
- `multiplication`: Performs matrix multiplication.
- `trace`: Computes the trace of a square matrix.
- `transpose`: Calculates the transpose of a matrix.
